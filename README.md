# AVL Tree Implementation in Java

## Project Description
This project implements an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree (BST), in Java. The AVL Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced after each insertion and deletion operation, maintaining an optimal height to guarantee efficient performance for search, insert, and delete operations, each with a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)

### Key Features
#### Self-Balancing 
Automatically balances itself during insertions and deletions to maintain 𝑂(log𝑛)  height.
#### Rotations
Implements left and right rotations to fix imbalances.
#### Height and Size Management
Keeps track of the height and size of each node.
#### Basic Operations
Supports insertion, deletion, finding minimum and maximum values, and checking for the presence of an element.
